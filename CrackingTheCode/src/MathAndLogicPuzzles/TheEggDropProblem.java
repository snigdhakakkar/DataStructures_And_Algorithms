/*
 * First observation: Regardless of how we drop egg1, egg 2 must do a linear search b/w lowest and highest i.e. the "breaking floor" and the next highest non-breaking floor.
 * For example if egg1 is dropped from floors 5 and 10 without breaking but it breaks when dropped from floor 15, then egg2 must be dropped, in the worst case from floors 11, 12, 13, 14.
 * 
 * Approach:
 * As a first try, let us suppose, we drop egg1 from the 10th floor, then the 20th floor..
 * if egg1 breaks on the first drop(floor 10), then we have at most 10 drops in total for egg2 to check.
 * if egg1 breaks on the last drop(floor 100), then we have at most 19 drops in total for egg2 to check.(floors 10, 20, 30....90, 91,92, 93...99)
 * That is good but we are still considering worst case scenarios only for egg2.
 * We should do some load balancing to make the above two cases even.
 * 
 * Our goal is to create a system for dropping egg1 such that the number of drops is as consistent as possible.
 * even if egg1 breaks on floor1 or floor 100 i.e. Drops(Egg1) + Drops(Egg2) is always the same, regardless of where egg1 breaks
 * For that to be the case, since each drop of egg1 takes one additional step, egg should be allowed one fewer step
 * We must thus reduce the number of steps potentially required by egg2 by one drop each time as drops for egg1 increases by 1 each time.
 * For example, if egg1 is dropped on floor 20, and then floor 30, egg 2 is potentially required to take 9 steps. Whe we drop egg1 again, we must reduce potential egg2 steps by 1.
 * That is we must drop egg1 at floor 39 instead of 40 next.
 * Therefore, egg1 must start at floor X, then go up by X-1 floors, then X-2 floors...
 * Solve for X : X + X - 1 + X - 2 + .... + 1 = 100 => X(X + 1)/2 = 100 => X ~ 13.65 
 * 
 * iF WE ROUND UP x to 14, then we would go up by 14, 13, 12 and so on. The last increment would be 4, which would happen on floor 99. 
 * If egg1 breaks before floor 99, then it is already load balanced, and if it does not break until floor 99
 * we just need one more drop of egg2 to check.
 * Either way, the number of drops is no more than 14.
 * 
 * On the other hand, if we round up to 13, then the last increment will be 1 which will happen at floor 91.
 * This is after 13 drops. Floors 92 to 100 have not been covered yet. We cannot cover these in just one drop.
 * Therefore, we should round up to 14 here.
