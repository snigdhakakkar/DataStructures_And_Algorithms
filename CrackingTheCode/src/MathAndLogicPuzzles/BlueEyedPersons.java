	 * Let us apply the base case and build approach. Assume there were n people on the island out of which c people were blue eyed. We are explicitly told that c > 0
	 * Case c = 1: Exactly one person is blue eyed.
	 * Assumign that all the people are intelligent, the blue-eyed person should look around and see that no one has blue eyes. Since no one but at least one person has blue eyes,
	 * he must conclude that it is him who has blue eyes and must leave the island in the evening flight.
	 * 
	 * Case c = 2, Exactly 2 people have blue eyes
	 * The two blue-eyes persons would ee each other but would be unsure if c = 1 or 2.
	 * They know from the previous case that if c = 1, the blue eyed person would leave the island the same evening.
	 * Therefore, if the other blue-eyed person is there, he must deduce c= 2, which means that he himself has blue eyes.
	 * Both men would then leave on the flight on second night.
