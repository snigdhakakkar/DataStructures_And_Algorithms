	 * If the two jugs are relatively prime sized, one can measure any value between one and the sum of the jug sizes.
	 * Suppose, we initially fill 5 Quart completely and 0 in 3 Quart jug
	 * Then, we move the contents to 3 Quart jug - 2,3 Quart in 5 Quart and 3 Quart jug respectively.
	 * Then, we emptyt he contents of 3 Quart jug as we dump it.
	 * SO, we move the remaining 2 quart content of jug 5 to jug 3.
	 * Now, we can fill 5 Quart more in 5 Quart jug. Then, we can move 1 quart to the 3 quart jug as it already has 2 quarts in it.
	 * The remaining water in 5 Quart jug would be 4 quarts.
