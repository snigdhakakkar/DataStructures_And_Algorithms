/*
 * widely used in code base
 * Creational design pattern - related to the creation of object
 * Factory pattern is used in case when a class is a super class and we have multiple sub-classes; we want to return the instance based on input
 * provides abstraction between implementation & client classes
 * remove the instantation of client classes from client code
 * 
 * superclass can be an abstract class / an interface / a basic java class
 * factory class has a static method which returns the instance of a sub-class based on the input
